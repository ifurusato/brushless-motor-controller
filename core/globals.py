def init():
    '''
    Creates an application-global dictionary as a way to share objects across
    all modules. This is only suitable for application-level singletons.

    Typical usage:

        import core.globals as globals
        globals.init()

        globals.put('variable-name', _value)
        _value = globals.get('variable-name')

    You can call your variables anything you like, but by convention, both
    for consistency and to clearly differentiate between actual variable
    names we are using dashes as delimiters within variable names.

    Note that you only need to call 'globals.init()' on your first module
    access or your main() method.
